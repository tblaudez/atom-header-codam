# header-codam package

This package is a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/Kerollmops/atom-header-42)  
All I did was changing the headers and the name of the lib.

An atom package to add the CODAM header to your files.

You can trigger it with the `cmd-alt-h` shortcut.

supported header formats are:
`#`, `/* */`, `<!-- -->`, `[[ ]]`, `(* *)`, `{- -}`, `;`
